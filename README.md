# Derivatives semester assignment

This repo contains the group assignment completed during the **Derivatives** 
course  at EPFL. During this project, I had the opportunity to learn how to 
calibrate a pricing model from existing market prices, as well as, pricing 
complex structured products, such as **reverse convertibles**, using binomial 
trees.
